# 🧪 Melting Pot

A multi-project sandbox for full stack experiments and learning.

This repo is a living space where I test new technologies, frameworks, and ideas as I continue growing as a full stack developer. Each subfolder represents a small standalone feature, experiment, or prototype — from UI concepts to backend APIs.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack (so far)

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (planned)
- **Other:** GitHub Projects for task tracking, Vite for bundling

## 🙋‍♂️ Why “Melting Pot”?

Because great learning happens when ideas collide. This repo reflects my goal to explore, blend, and refine skills across the full stack — one concept at a time.
